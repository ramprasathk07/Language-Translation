## üåç Transformer-based Text Language Translation Model
### Overview
This repository hosts a text language translation model built using Transformer architecture. The model is designed to translate text between multiple languages with high accuracy, leveraging advanced neural network techniques. It is capable of handling various language pairs and has been fine-tuned on extensive datasets to provide optimal performance.

## Model Architecture
The model is built on the Transformer architecture, which includes:

- Encoder-Decoder: For mapping input sequences to output sequences.
- Self-Attention Mechanism: To capture dependencies between words.
- Positional Encoding: To retain word order information.
- Multi-Head Attention: For parallel processing of multiple attention mechanisms

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch
- Transformers Library (`transformers`)
- Tokenizers (`tokenizers`)
- Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
## Installation Steps

You can customize the model's behavior by modifying the config.yaml file. This includes changing hyperparameters, model paths, and more.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/translation-transformer.git
    cd translation-transformer
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Alternatively, you can use the command-line interface (CLI):
    ```bash
    python translate.py --source_lang en --target_lang fr --text "Hello, how are you?"
    ```
